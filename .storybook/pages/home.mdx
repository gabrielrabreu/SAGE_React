# SAGE UI

Welcome to **SAGE UI**, a library of reusable React components designed to streamline UI development.

---

## Overview

SAGE UI is a collection of components built with React and TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of UI elements that can be easily integrated into your projects.

---

## Component Categories

### 1. Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of the UI. They include simple components such as buttons, inputs, and icons.

### 2. Molecules

Molecules are combinations of atoms that form more complex UI components. Examples include form fields, cards, and navigation bars.

### 3. Organisms

Organisms are higher-level components that combine molecules and atoms to create complete sections of a UI. Examples include forms, hero sections, and product lists.

### 4. Pages

Pages represent entire pages or views of an application. They typically consist of multiple organisms and may include routing and data fetching logic.

### 5. Templates

Templates provide reusable layouts or structures for common page types, such as blogs, e-commerce sites, or dashboards.
